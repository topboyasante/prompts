## Codebase Index

This project has a living `docs/` folder with architecture, implementation, patterns, decisions, and changelog files.

### Session Start
- Read `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/implementation.md` before doing any work.
- These files contain the project map — do not re-scan the codebase from scratch.

### After Every Feature or Bugfix
1. Run `git diff HEAD~1 --name-only` to identify changed files.
2. Re-scan only the changed files and their direct neighbors (same package/directory).
3. Update the relevant doc files using targeted edits (do not rewrite unaffected sections):
   - New module/package → update `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/implementation.md`
   - New class/function/endpoint → update `docs/implementation.md`
   - Renamed files/folders → update `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/patterns.md`
   - New dependency → update `docs/architecture.md`
   - New naming/code pattern → update `docs/patterns.md`
4. Ask: "Did this change involve making or reversing an architectural decision?"
   - If yes → append an ADR entry to `docs/decisions.md`
   - If no → skip
5. Append a dated changelog entry to `docs/changelog.md`:
   ```
